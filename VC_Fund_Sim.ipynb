        "Welcome to this financial simulation notebook! This tool allows you to simulate venture capital fund performance based on various assumptions and compare the outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "The notebook is organized into the following sections:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Import Libraries:** Essential libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and interactive widgets.\n",
        "2.  **Math Functions:** Contains the `irr` function for calculating the Internal Rate of Return.\n",
        "3.  **Assumptions Management:** Code to create folders for assumptions and results, and a widget to select JSON assumption files from your Colab environment.\n",
        "4.  **Simulation Functions:** The core logic for running a single simulation run.\n",
        "5.  **Run Simulations:** This section loads your selected assumptions, runs multiple simulations for each set, saves the detailed results and fund metrics to CSV files in the `results/` folder, and stores the summarized results for comparison.\n",
        "6.  **Visualization:** Plots to compare the simulation results across different assumption files.\n",
        "7.  **Extra Cells (Appendix):** Additional code that might be useful to debug by running a single simulation but is not part of the main workflow.\n",
        "\n",
        "To use this notebook, follow the steps in each section sequentially."
